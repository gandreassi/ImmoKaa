# ImmoKaa
Webscraping Immoscout.ch in order to analyse the housing market.

Kaa is a famous character of The Jungle Book. Scouts use names from the book, and Kaa is a python, so... I guess that's a funny name for this repo.

This code takes inspiration (and sometimes even full pieces of code) from https://github.com/balzer82/immoscraper
